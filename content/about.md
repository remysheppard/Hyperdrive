My name is Remy Sheppard. I'm a Christian, husband, animal welfare advocate, and founder of **Hyperdrive Website Development**.

When I'm not at work, I enjoy spending time with my wife of 8 years and our 3 cats. Hobbies of mine including blogging and podcasting.

I'm currently studying to be a pastor in the [American Association of Lutheran Churches](https://www.taalc.org) and hope to have my studies completed and be ordained sometime before 2025.
