### Special Non-Profit Pricing Available!

If you need a website for your church or Chrisitan Non-Profit organization, we can help! I'm on the board at my own church and see just how tight finances can get for these kinds of groups. To make things easier, I'm offering my services to specially qualified churches and non-profits at a discounted rate of **$75 a month**. 

#### How do we qualify?

If you fully and readily agree with the following statements, I would be more than happy to build a website for your church or non-profit at the discounted rate:

* The Bible *is* the Word of God.
	* The Bible is *infallible and inerrant*.
* We subscribe to the Book of Concord *because* it is the clear exposition of Christian Doctrine.
* Baptism Now Saves You.
* This *is* My Body.

If you agree with these statements, please reach out!
